# Glorious Uzbekistan (Victoria 3 Mod) — Version 1

## What this mod is
This mod adds **Uzbekistan** as a playable country setup for 1836, with a custom set of Uzbek state regions and history.

It’s for players who want an Uzbekistan-focused start and a more detailed Uzbekistan map layout.

## What’s included (Version 1)

### Country
- **UZB (Uzbekistan)** country tag and English localization (name, adjective, and “definite form” name).

### Map / States (Uzbekistan coverage)
- **12 Uzbekistan state regions + 1 autonomous region** setup (Karakalpakstan).
- States included (as currently defined in your files):
  - Samarqand
  - Navoi
  - Surkhandarya
  - Bukhara
  - Kashkadarya
  - Jizzakh
  - Toshkent
  - Syr Darya
  - Andijan
  - Namangan
  - Karakalpakstan (Autonomous region)
  - Fergana
- (Also present in state history: Khorezm)

### Custom state traits
- **Silk Road Hub**: Intended for Samarqand/Bukhara to boost trade and silk.
- **Fergana Valley**: Intended for Andijan/Namangan/Fergana to boost agriculture.
- **Aral Sea (1836)**: Intended for Karakalpakstan to boost fishing.

### Cultures (work in progress)
- Added a custom culture definition intended for **Bukharian Jews**.
- **Note**: This is still WIP in Version 1; names/values may be adjusted in later versions.

## Known issues / notes (Version 1)
- Balance is not final; resource numbers and modifiers may change.
- Some localization and data may be refined (spelling, capitalization, descriptions).
- Early-game balance note: some starting building levels may be adjusted to avoid severe negative infrastructure before railways.

## Roadmap (next versions)
- Finish and polish **Bukharian Jews** culture (names, pops integration, and/or additional flavor).
- More Uzbek flavor content (events, journal entries, characters) if desired.

### Planned journal entries
- **Ulughbek's Scholars**: Education and innovation focus (universities, literacy, innovation).
- **Forge the Amir Temur Army**: Military modernization and arms industry.
- **Claims of Amir Temur and Babur**: Reclaim historic Timurid lands in Central Asia, Persia, and India.
- **Timurid Golden Era**: High literacy, low turmoil, strong economy, and higher standard of living.
- **Frontiers of the Steppe**: Colonial expansion with Colonial Affairs investment and colonial subjects.
