#TUTORIAL: When you create a new country, you must assign states to it, and that's what this file is for
#TUTORIAL: This only explains how to change the ownership \ homelands of already exsiting states, if you want to create a state then see the states creation tutorial
#TUTORIAL: You only need to create one txt file, call it your mod's name (Example: communitypatch_states.txt, modernday_states.txt)
#TUTORIAL: Then you need to copy over the state you wanna modify from game\common\history\states\states.txt like the following
#TUTORIAL: Make sure that the file starts with STATES = { and ends with an }
#TUTORIAL: All states added here, must be added here as well: game\common\history\pops (See the tutorial there)
#TUTORIAL: In our case, our Tutorial Nation will own Albania, Bosnia, Montenegro, Southern Serbia, Dalmatia and North Macedonia
