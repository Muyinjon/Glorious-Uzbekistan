#TUTORIAL IMPORTANT: You do not need to create characters, the game already generates them for you. You would only create characters if you want to
#TUTORIAL IMPORTANT: If you do create a character, you need to add their names to localization, to do so do the following:
#TUTORIAL IMPORTANT: You can see the tutorial for adding characters to localization here: game\localization\english\zz_tutorial_characters_names_l_english.yml

CHARACTERS = {

	#TUTORIAL Replace TUT with your country's tag
	c:TUT = {
	
		create_character = {
		
			#TUTORIAL Replace "Maureen" with the first name of your character
			#TUTORIAL Replace "Miller" with the last name of your character
			first_name = "Maureen"
			last_name = "Miller"
			
			#TUTORIAL Change X to (yes\no) to choose whether or not you want this character to be a female (no means the character is a male)
			female = yes
			
			#TUTORIAL Change X to (yes\no) to choose whether or not you want this character to be known as a noble
			noble = yes
			
			#TUTORIAL Change X to (yes\no) to choose whether or not you want this character to be ruler or heir of the country at start of game
			ruler = yes
			#heir = no
			
			#TUTORIAL Change X to (yes\no) to choose whether or not you want this character to be an interest group leader
			ig_leader = yes
			
			#TUTORIAL Change X to the age you want your character to be at start of game
			age = 25
			
			#TUTORIAL Replace X with one of these (ig_devout, ig_armed_forces, ig_landowners, ig_intelligentsia, ig_petty_bourgeoisie, ig_rural_folk, ig_industrialists)
			interest_group = ig_landowners
			
			#TUTORIAL Replace X with one of the leader ideologies, you can find them here: game\common\ideologies\00_leader_ideologies.txt
			ideology = ideology_moderate
			
			#TUTORIAL Here you can choose the traits of your character
			#TUTORIAL Replace ALL the traits below with as many traits as you wish from here: game\common\character_traits\personality_traits.txt
			traits = {
						romantic charismatic
			}
			
		}
	}
}

		#TUTORIAL If the first or last name has more than two words, then you need to use "_" instead of space, see an example:
		#TUTORIAL Example: ( First name: "Jean Francois" must be entered below as: first_name = "Jean_Francois" )
		#TUTORIAL Then you need to add it in localization with a space (I added an example in localization, go see it), see the following example:
		#first_name = "Jean_Francois"
		#last_name = "Roberge"
