#TUTORIAL: For more explanation, please read the "Must read before you start.txt"

#TUTORIAL Replace TRI with your nation's country tag
TRI = {
	#TUTORIAL Don't change this
	pattern = "pattern_solid.tga"
	
	#TUTORIAL for color1, you need to choose what background color you want to give your nation's flag, replace black by something else
	color1 = "black"
	
	#TUTORIAL After you chose the background color, you need to now identify all the colors that are going to be involved in the flag like the following:
	#TUTORIAL If you're adding the Modren Day Libya flag, which has 4 colors (Red, blue, green and white) you need to choose one color to be the background and two colors to be secondary
	#TUTORIAL We already chose black to be background, now to add secondary colors you need to add lines like these:
	color2 = "red"
	color3 = "green"
	color4 = "white"
	#TUTORIAL Read the "Must read before you start.txt" to better understand, actually you shouldn't be reading this if you didn't read "Must read before you start.txt" first =)
	
	#TUTORIAL We need to add colored_emblem code for every different color, us we're adding 3 more secondary colors so we're doing it like this:
	colored_emblem = {
	
		#TUTORIAL Replace libya_tutorial_green.dds with the file name you created in game\gfx\coat_of_arms\colored_emblems
		texture = "libya_tutorial_green.dds"
		
		#TUTORIAL Here you choose what color is this emblem supposed to be shown in the game as, us we want it green so we do it like this:
		color1 = "green"
	}
	
	colored_emblem = {
	
		#TUTORIAL Replace libya_tutorial_red.dds with the file name you created in game\gfx\coat_of_arms\colored_emblems
		texture = "libya_tutorial_red.dds"
		
		#TUTORIAL Here you choose what color is this emblem supposed to be shown in the game as, us we want it red so we do it like this:
		color1 = "red"
	}
	
	colored_emblem = {
	
		#TUTORIAL Replace libya_tutorial_white.dds with the file name you created in game\gfx\coat_of_arms\colored_emblems
		texture = "libya_tutorial_white.dds"
		
		#TUTORIAL Here you choose what color is this emblem supposed to be shown in the game as, us we want it white so we do it like this:
		color1 = "white"
	}
